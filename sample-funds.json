  "description": "I was recently accepted into a study abroad program that will allow me to pursue my goals of learning about grassroots organizations and movements specifically working to liberate poor and working class people of color around the globe. Through this program, I will be able to study in Brazil, India, and South Africa during my fall semester. However, this trip will not be possible without a lot of sacrifice. I am receiving some financial-aid through my school, but it is not able to cover all of the expenses for this trip. I am saving up all of my summer earnings, but it is still not enough.",

    "description": "After completing college I plan to enroll in dental school. Therefore, while in Italy I'm hoping to compare and contrast the operational methods of the healthcare system abroad to those of the healthcare system here in the U.S. Gaining international knowledge pertaining to dental medicine would allow me to learn unique techniques which I could incorporate into my future professional studies.Upon graduating from dental school, I intend on using my broadcast journalism background to create and host my own dental television show, like Dr. Oz and Dr. Gupta, to educate people on proper oral hygiene. This trip would therefore lay the foundation for my future success.",

    "description": "All of the money raised will go to pay my tuition, room, board, and living expenses while I am in Switzerland. This includes the cost of my work visa and other fees associated with studying and working abroad. The cost estimate for studying in Geneva is here. The semester is going to cost about $20,000. I have some financial aid and a little family assistance, but this semester is going to be very tough to manage. If I could raise as much of the $20,000 as possible, it would ease the burden on my mom and me. My goal is to raise half of the costs, about $10,000.",
